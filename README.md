# Simulations of Phenotypic Evolution in a Mutualistic System

Serrapilheira/ICTP-SAIFR Training Program in Quantitative Biology and Ecology

## Background

In the contextualization of classical models of sympatric speciation at the ecological community level, with consideration of the antagonistic or synergistic effects of other selective pressures imposed by different ecological interactions, this is a step in the investigation of the interaction of different modes of natural selection in the origin of biodiversity.
